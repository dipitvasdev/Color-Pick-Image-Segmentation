# Color Pallete Generator and Image Segmentation

This web application utilizes K Means algorithm to extract a color palette from an uploaded image. The extracted colors are carefully analyzed and selected to create a visually appealing and harmonious color scheme. In addition, this application generates a segmented image that showcases the areas where the colors were picked in the original image. This feature provides users with a deeper understanding of the color palette and allows them to use it more effectively in their designs. This application is perfect for designers, artists, photographers, and organizations who want to simplify the color selection process and elevate their visual content.
